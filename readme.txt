== Description ==

Avoid those pesky blank page with an error message like &ldquo;please fill out required fields&rdquo; then loosing your/users comment info. This plugin aims to help by adding validation to the comment form. When a user submits the form and something is missing, an appropiate message is displayed and individual fields are highlighted. When the email or url is in an incorrect format, a message is displayed accordingly. Requires the user to have javascript activated.

**Why should you install it?** Because you care for comments and want to help users reduce mistakes that hold them off from commenting at all.

**Whats the technology used?** [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and the [jQuery Validation plugin](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/) with a few customizations to make it fit into any WordPress theme.
