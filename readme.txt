Avoid those pesky blank page with an error message like "please fill out required fields" then loosing your/users comment info. Validation with javascript.

== Description ==

Avoid those pesky blank page with an error message like &ldquo;please fill out required fields&rdquo; then loosing your/users comment info. This plugin aims to help by adding validation to the comment form. When a user submits the form and something is missing, an appropiate message is displayed and individual fields are highlighted. When the email or url is in an incorrect format, a message is displayed accordingly. Requires the user to have javascript activated.

**Why should you install it?** Because you care for comments and want to help users reduce mistakes that hold them off from commenting at all.

**Whats the technology used?** [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and the [jQuery Validation plugin](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/) with a few customizations to make it fit into any WordPress theme.

== Installation ==

Follow the steps below to install the plugin.

1. Upload the `anywhere` folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings/Validation Reloaded to edit your settings.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why create this plugin? =
Because there is a newer validation script out there, but no updated plugins. 


= I think i want to uninstall but... =
Be sure to click the uninstall script that you **manually** add a value to `define( 'UNINSTALL_COMM', '' )` on line 29. That means `1` OR like this: `define( 'UNINSTALL_COMM', '1' )`. After that run the script and all options should be uninstalled. **Note: This script will only work for WordPress 3.0 or less**
